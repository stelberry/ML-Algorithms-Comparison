## Week 6 (03/10/2025)

- Implemented Conformal Predictor that calculate the alpha = d_diff/d_same (distance to nearest different-class neighbor / distance to nearest same-class neighbor)
- Use this conformity score function to calculate p-values and avearage false p-value
- Will function it with the actual dataset in week 7

## Week 5 (01/10/2025)

- Implemented kNN algorithm and tested with artificial simple dataset.
- Handled ties in kNN.
- Implemented tie-breaking by choosing randomly and alphabetically.

## Week 5 (27/10/2025)

- Load and test the 1NN algorithm with Iris dataset.
- Evulate the accuracy score of the dataset to examine the model's performance.
- Tested with new unlabeled data.

## Week 4 (24/10/2025)

- Implemented 1NN algorithm from scratch using simple artificial dataset.

## Week 4 (23/10/2025)

- Finshed reading Chapter 1 and 2 of **Machine Learning in Action** by Peter Harrington which explained kNN algorithm concept, impelmentation details and testing with datasets.
- Gained understanding of how to evaluate kNN using simple datasets and measure prediction accuracy.

## Week 3 (14/10/2025)

- Finished reading chapter 1,2,3 of **Introduction to machine learning with Python** by Müller, A.C. and Guido, S.
- Chapter 1 explains the basic concept of machine learning.
- Chapter 2 explains the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning, classification and regression algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Models, Support Vector Machines(SVM), and Decision Trees.
- Chapter 3 explains algorithms such as k-Means clustering and Principal Component Analysis(PCA) for data visualisation and dimensionality reduction, and covers data preprocessing techniques.
- Learned the foundations of ML and how algorithms are categorized, how to implement and evaluate basic models in scikit-learn, and the importance of data preparation and model evaluation for accurate ML results.
