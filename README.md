## Aims
To implement supervised learning algorithms from scratch and evaluate their performance on UCI Default of Credit Card Clients dataset.
## Objects
- Implementation: Develop vector-optimized 1-NN, k-NN and Decision Tree (CART) algorithms in Python.
- Preprocessing`: Develop a robust pipeline to handle class imbalance (22%) and feature scaling for financial data.
- Optimization`: Apply Tie-Breaking strategies and Hyperparameter Tuning to improve model stability.
- Evaluation`: Compute the accuracy of the models using a held-out test set.
